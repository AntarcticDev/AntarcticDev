# OpenPGP

If you want to check if the project or text was officially written by me, I release the PGP keys. To check if the message was written by me, check if there is a folder in the repository called 'pgp', there will be all the headers necessary to verify the message. We recommend using [PGP Tool](https://pgptool.org/) as it is a simpler way to handle OpenPGP, but you can do this in any way.
